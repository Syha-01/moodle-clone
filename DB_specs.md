Database Schema Design
This schema is designed to be relational, which is a great fit for the structured data of a quiz application. We'll define several tables that are linked together.
Here's a visual overview of the tables and their relationships:

+-------------+      +-----------+      +---------------+      +--------------------+
|  subjects   |      |  quizzes  |      |   questions   |      |  question_options  |
+-------------+      +-----------+      +---------------+      +--------------------+
| id (PK)     |      | id (PK)   |      | id (PK)       |      | id (PK)            |
| name        |      | name      |      | quiz_id (FK)  |      | question_id (FK)   |
| user_id(FK) |      | subject_id(FK)|    | question_text |      | option_text        |
+-------------+      | user_id(FK) |    | question_type |      | is_correct         |
                     | time_limit|    | image_url     |      +--------------------+
                     +-----------+      +---------------+

+---------------+      +---------------------+
| short_answers |      |    quiz_attempts    |
+---------------+      +---------------------+
| id (PK)       |      | id (PK)             |
| question_id(FK)|      | quiz_id (FK)        |
| answer_text   |      | user_id (FK)        |
+---------------+      | score               |
                       | start_time          |
                       | end_time            |
                       +---------------------+

Table Definitions
Below are the detailed definitions for each table. You can use the provided SQL statements directly in the Supabase SQL Editor to create your tables.

1. subjects

This table stores the different subjects your quizzes can belong to, like "Mathematics" or "World History".
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
id	uuid	Primary Key, default: gen_random_uuid()	A unique identifier for each subject.
name	text	Not Null	The name of the subject.
created_at	timestamptz	default: now()	The date and time the subject was created.
user_id	uuid	Foreign Key to auth.users	The user (teacher) who created the subject.

SQL for subjects table:

CREATE TABLE subjects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

2. quizzes

This table holds the core information about each quiz.

Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
id	uuid	Primary Key, default: gen_random_uuid()	A unique identifier for the quiz.
name	text	Not Null	The title of the quiz.
subject_id	uuid	Foreign Key to subjects	Links the quiz to a subject.
time_limit_minutes	integer		The duration of the quiz in minutes. This can be NULL if the quiz is not timed.
created_at	timestamptz	default: now()	The date and time the quiz was created.
user_id	uuid	Foreign Key to auth.users	The user (teacher) who created the quiz.
SQL for quizzes table:

CREATE TABLE quizzes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject_id UUID REFERENCES subjects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  time_limit_minutes INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

3. questions

This table stores the individual questions for each quiz.
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
id	uuid	Primary Key, default: gen_random_uuid()	A unique identifier for the question.
quiz_id	uuid	Foreign Key to quizzes	Links the question to a specific quiz.
question_text	text	Not Null	The text of the question itself.
question_type	text		The format of the question, e.g., 'multiple_choice' or 'short_answer'.
image_url	text		A URL pointing to an image in Supabase Storage. NULL if there is no image.
created_at	timestamptz	default: now()	The date and time the question was created.
SQL for questions table:

CREATE TABLE questions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  quiz_id UUID REFERENCES quizzes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  question_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (question_type IN ('multiple_choice', 'short_answer')),
  image_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

4. question_options

For multiple-choice questions, this table stores the possible answers.
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
id	uuid	Primary Key, default: gen_random_uuid()	A unique identifier for the option.
question_id	uuid	Foreign Key to questions	Links this option to a specific question.
option_text	text	Not Null	The text of the choice, e.g., "Paris".
is_correct	boolean	default: false	Set to true if this is the correct answer.
created_at	timestamptz	default: now()	The date and time the option was created.
SQL for question_options table:

CREATE TABLE question_options (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  question_id UUID REFERENCES questions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  option_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_correct BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

5. short_answers

This table stores the correct answer(s) for short-answer questions.
Column Name	Data Type	Constraints	Description
id	uuid	Primary Key, default: gen_random_uuid()	A unique identifier for the answer.
question_id	uuid	Foreign Key to questions	Links this answer to a specific question.
correct_answer	text	Not Null	The correct answer text.
created_at	timestamptz	default: now()	The date and time the answer was created.
SQL for short_answers table:

CREATE TABLE short_answers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  question_id UUID REFERENCES questions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  correct_answer TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

Handling Image Uploads

For questions with images, you will use Supabase Storage. The workflow is as follows:
Upload the Image: In your React application, when a teacher creates a question with an image, you first upload the image file to a Supabase Storage bucket (e.g., a bucket named question_images).
Get the URL: After the upload is successful, Supabase will provide a public or signed URL for the image.
Store the URL: You then save this URL in the image_url column of your questions table for the relevant question.
This approach keeps your database lightweight by not storing binary file data directly, which is a best practice.

Next Steps and Considerations

User Attempts: You will likely want to add tables to track students taking the quizzes. Consider creating a quiz_attempts table and a user_answers table to store their submissions and scores.
Row-Level Security (RLS): A key feature of Supabase is RLS. You should set up RLS policies on your tables to ensure that users can only access and modify the data they are permitted to. For example, a teacher should only be able to edit quizzes they have created.
API Usage: With this structure, you can easily query your data. For instance, to get a quiz with all its questions and options, you can use a single API call with nested joins.
